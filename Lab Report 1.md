Hello! So today (4/6/23) I took my first lab for CSE 15L. It was quite a nice lab to set things up for this course. I was able to meet my peers, setup my cse15l account, connect to the remote server using that account, running commands in the remote server, and setup my github with my lab report repository. To log into the remote server for 15l, you first need to reset your password using you account starting with "cs15lsp23" followed by your 2 unique characters. You will need to log in with your UCSD single sign on at [this webpage](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php). You should then be able to click on a box with your "cs15lspxx" account. After clicking that, you will see a prompt to set your password shown here: ![Image](https://github.com/whatuptj/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/main/Prompt.png)
MAKE SURE TO INPUT YOUR "cs15lspxx" ACCOUNT OR ELSE YOU WILL CHANGE YOUR SINGLE SIGN ON PASSWORD LIKE I DID :(. 
The program that will be used to access the remote server is called Visual Studio Code, aka VSCode. After installing VSCode, you may need to install the program "git" if you are on a Windows system. Since I am using MacOS, I skipped this step. For a more detailed tutorial you can follow [this link](https://ucsd-cse15l-s23.github.io/week/week1/#due-dates--links) and follow the steps listed under "Part 4 - Remotely Connecting". After installing and opening VSCode you should see something that looks like this: ![Image](https://github.com/whatuptj/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/main/VSCode.png)
